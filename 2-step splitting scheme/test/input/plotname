-------------------------
ufluid:   fluid velocity
press:    pressure
usolid:   solid velocity
disp:     solid displacment
stress:   Cauchy stress

Note: if you do not want, such as, pressure to be sotored, then just delete "press".
At the same time, when visualising the results, you should also modify the files 
'fluid_gidpost.dof' and 'fluid_gidpost'
in /post: delete the pressure lines.
